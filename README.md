<h2>Promotional Micro-site for a one-off art show sponsored by PBRart.</P>

<ul>
Project Details:

<li>HTML5, CSS3 framework built onto a custom responsive grid.</li>

<li>JPlayer used for serving up music (you can find a fork in my repo library)</li>

<li>Social Media markup for facebook attachs the URL to all Facebook posts when the URL is placed in a post</li>

</ul>

<p>A small collective of artists were tasked with putting together a small gallery show. With help from two of the illustrators the main look of the site was accomplished.</p>
